### Abandon Date

### Scenario

On a forum which used BBCode for formatting, people wanted a way to include video files hosted as plain files into their posts (such as documentaries from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)).

### Solution

An add-on that includes plain video files with device's native player into the post.
